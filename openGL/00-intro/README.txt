Demo programs to introduce OpenGL

For Linux:

    Execute 'make'
    
    Run the code as, for example, ./demo1

For Windows:

    A Visual Studio project has been provided for demo3.
 
    After opening the project, choose 'x86' beside the 'Debug'
    configuration box.  Then press F7 to compile.

    You can create solutions for the other demos by removing the
    demo3.cpp file from the project and adding the files of a
    different demo.
